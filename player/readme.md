# Music Player

This program demonstrates the A96 audio codec. The goal for A96 is 6:1
compression with no noticable loss of quality, that decompresses at 30x
realtime on a P166 MMX.

That is, a little less space efficenct than MP3, but fast enough to background
decode on the fly in realtime in a game.

V0.1
- Initial version
- Plays tracks compressed in A96 format
